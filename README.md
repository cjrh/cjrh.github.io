I am building a static site around the IPython Notebook.  Each posts is a notebook `.ipynb` file and 
some tooling (included) converts the notebooks into basic HTML fragments, and creates metadata that
is used to configure navigation between posts in the HTML view of the site. 

HTML and javascript have been set up to load the posts, and navigate between them. The styling has
all been done using [Sass/Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and I intend to structure the styling
such that a simple theme format will be possible.
