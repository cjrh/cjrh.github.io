I have found it very useful to have a batch file \"activate\" the path and environment for the Microsoft compilers. I make two of these batch files, one for each SDK, and **place these somewhere on my system path.** Editing the system path is painful so I use an excellent freeware product called (Rapid Environment Editor)[http://www.rapidee.com/en/about] to add new path entries, or check whether my existing path entries are valid: non-existing paths will be highlighted in red.  This is a great application.\n",
