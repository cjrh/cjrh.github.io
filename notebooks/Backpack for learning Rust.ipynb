    "## Simple error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're learning Rust, most of your programs are probably going to be command-line programs, i.e., applications. I strongly suggest you use a crate called `anyhow` to help you deal with error handling. Rust is quite pedantic about types and it can be a frustrating experience trying to figure out exactly how to deal with error types.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never want to deal with error types, you could just call `.unwrap()` on every `Result` type; however, this is a bad habit to get into, even when you're just learning. For one thing, it means that later you will have to go back and fix up all the `.unwrap()` calls if you get to the point where you want to clean up your program. But the more unfortunate thing is that you never get to learn how to deal with errors correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the dilemma:\n",
    "- You want to avoid calling `.unwrap()`\n",
    "- You also want to avoid writing `match` statements every single time some function returns a `Result` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? This scenario is described in The Book, where the `?` operator is introduced. Within a function that returns `Result`, if you call another function that returns `Result` you can use `?` to automatically either get the `Ok()` value, or propagate the `Err` up to the caller. That's wordy, but this is all I mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn my_func() -> Result<(), ...> {\n",
    "    let x = some_other_func()?;   \n",
    "    Ok(())\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `some_other_func` returns a `Result`. If that `Result` is an `Ok` enum, the value will be assigned to `x`; but if the `Result` is an `Err` enum, that will be returned from `my_func` (and `x` will never have been assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `?` is great, but there's a big problem: the ellipses I used for the error type returned by `my_func` above is quite complicated to deal with if it doesn't match the `Err` type that `some_other_func()` can return. If the two error types are incompatible, the Rust compiler will complain. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use `anyhow`, you won't have to worry about error types. The code will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "use anyhow::Result;\n",
    "\n",
    "fn my_func() -> Result<()> {\n",
    "    let x = some_other_func()?;    \n",
    "    Ok(())\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you _don't_ use `anyhow`, and the two error types are incompatible, you will have to \"box\" the error type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "use std::err::Error;\n",
    "\n",
    "fn my_func() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {\n",
    "    let x = some_other_func()?;      \n",
    "    Ok(())\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion: just use `anyhow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in your journey when you start making crates for other people to use, it can be useful to use the `thiserror` crate rather than the `anyhow` crate. `thiserror` provides conveniences for creating specific named error types that consumers of your crate can use. Both `anyhow` and `thiserror` are made by the same person, David Tolnay."

    "\n",
    "The `profile.release` section enables full \"link time optimization\" (LTO) which gives the linker more opportunity for applying performance optimizations. Likewise the `codegen-units` also allows the possibility of additional optimizations. Both of these will be at the expense of compile time so these settings should only be used when building a final release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final setting, `profile.dev.package.\"*\"`, tells cargo to build your *dependencies* in release mode, even when you're building your dev package in debug mode. The main benefit of this is that your debug build can still run quite fast, depending on what it's doing. This can sometimes dramatically help performance in interactive applications like games, generative art and similar applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if necessary you can override these and any other settings by creating a file `./.cargo/config.toml` inside any of your cargo projects."

    "## Setting up logging\n",
