    "# Calling D (dlang) shared libs from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The D programming language is attractive for making native extensions\n",
    "for Python, for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax features of D are excellent\n",
    "- Very fast compilation speed\n",
    "\n",
    "But the primary benefit for this use case is build native extensions\n",
    "in a modern systems programming language (i.e., not C), and to use\n",
    "that same binary across multiple versions of Python. Building a \n",
    "binary once is very attractive! Currently with Cython, for example, the\n",
    "extension module must be built on the target platform for *each version\n",
    "of Python* that is supported. Here, we're trying to make it so that\n",
    "it would be possible to build the native extension without even \n",
    "requiring Python to be installed on the build machine. (Of course, \n",
    "Python would still be required to run tests and verify binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is similar (in the basic idea) to how the \n",
    "[milksnake](https://github.com/getsentry/milksnake) project \n",
    "uses CFFI to wrap rust-produced binaries in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to run a *Python* program that uses CFFI to call a \n",
    "function inside a native extension written in D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you must install CFFI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pip install cffi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python file below will use the ABI mode of loading the dll:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# blah.py\n",
    "from cffi import FFI\n",
    "\n",
    "ffi = FFI()\n",
    "ffi.cdef(\"int foo();\")\n",
    "C = ffi.dlopen(\"blah.dll\")\n",
    "x = C.foo()\n",
    "print(f\"Called the dll, and the result was {x}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the file must produce the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python blah.py\n",
    "Called the dll, and the result was 123 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the less-work _ABI mode_ of CFFI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows it's a bit odd because you need some entrypoint code\n",
    "inside the shared library. This is just boilerplate though. Focus\n",
    "on the actual exported functions at the bottom:\n",

    "standard library.\n",
    "- Obviously `-shared` is necessary to make a shared library.\n",
