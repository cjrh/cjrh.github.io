<p>I have for some time now been writing Python code using the four tools in the heading; however, something has been bugging me. When launching vim from a terminal (actually iTerm2), it would find and use the system Python in <code>usr/local/bin</code> rather than the Anaconda Python I had installed in my home folder, but added to my shell path.</p>
<p>This did not happen with the <code>bash</code> shell, but that didn't occur to me at the time. <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/wiki/Unix-shell-initialization">This excellent guide</a> explains how different dot files are loaded.</p>

<p>It turns out that zsh installs <code>/etc/zshenv</code> and this file uses <em>path_handler</em> to prepend system paths to <code>$PATH</code>. <code>~/.zprofile</code> is sourced <em>before</em> this happens, so no matter what you put in your custom <code>zprofile</code>, it will be clobbered by system paths.</p>
