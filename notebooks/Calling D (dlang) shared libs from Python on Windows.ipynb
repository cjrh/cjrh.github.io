    "# Calling D (dlang) shared libs from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The D programming language is attractive for making native extensions\n",
    "for Python, for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax features of D are excellent\n",
    "- Very fast compilation speed\n",
    "- No C runtime problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to run a *Python* program that uses CFFI to call a function inside a native extension written in D.\n",
    "Now the Python file:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you must install CFFI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pip install cffi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python file below will use the ABI mode of loading the dll:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from cffi import FFI\n",
    "\n",
    "ffi = FFI()\n",
    "ffi.cdef(\"int foo();\")\n",
    "C = ffi.dlopen(\"blah.dll\")\n",
    "x = C.foo()\n",
    "print(f\"Called the dll, and the result was {x}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the file must produce the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python blah.py\n",
    "Called the dll, and the result was 123 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows it's a bit odd because you need some entrypoint code\n",
    "inside the shared library. This is just boilerplate though. Focus\n",
    "on the actual exported functions at the bottom:\n",
    "\n",
    "```d\n",

    "$ dmd -m64 -betterC -shared -ofblah.dll blah.d blah.def\n",

    "is important if you want to load it into a 64-bit Python application.\n",
    "- We're passing the `-betterC` flag to indicate we don't need the D \n",
    "standard library.\n",
    "- Obviously `-shared` is necessary to make a shared library.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building, you can inspect the DLL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls -lah blah.*\n",
    "-rw-r--r-- 1 caleb 197121  697 May  5 12:01 blah.d\n",
