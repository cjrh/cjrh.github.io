      "I have experience with Python development on all three of the major platforms: Windows, OSX and Linux. The cross-platform features of Python are deeply wonderful, allowing you to transfer much code effortlessy between these platforms.  It is frequently the case that I start a project on Windows, leave work and go home in the evening, continue where I left off on OSX, (run a quick test on Linux if necessary), and then again continue on Windows the following day.\n",

      "This series of posts will discuss the various habits I have adopted over the years to keep a clean workflow. It didn't start this way: my initial workflows were bad, and painful experiences and many lost hours have brought me to this point.  I cannot say that my habits are best, or possibly even desirable; only that I have tried to improve them as far as I could, and I have tried to keep up to date with what others are doing."
