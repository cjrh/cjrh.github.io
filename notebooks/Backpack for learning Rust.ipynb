    "\n",
    "This tripped me up quite a bit in the beginning. Saying \"2 kinds of strings\" really doesn't explain anything. Here's the deal: `&str` isn't really a string, it's a reference to a \"string slice\". I'm not going to get into what is a slice, but the important part of that statement is the word *reference*. As soon as you have a reference, you will have to deal with *lifetimes* and that's where things can get complicated.\n",

    "While you're learning, and likely even beyond that, I suggest that when you find trouble, create a new `String` instance *from* the `&str`, using either the `.to_string()` method, or `.to_owned()`. This is pretty much just cloning string data. This allocates a bit of new memory that has no strings attached to anything else, so it's good for: \n",

You can passing `String` values to a function expecting an `&str` value, because there is built-in support in the `String` type to automatically produce a `&str` that works. That string slice refers back to the underlying memory within the `String` so this is a very efficient and flexible option. Such functions can therefore receive both `&str` and `String` types."

    "# Don't fear the turbofish `::<>`\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started with Rust I was afraid of the turbofish. It seemed so alien, arcane and complex.  It is not so. The turbofish is like a pet someone brought along to the party. You just need a little time to get to know each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turbofish gives you a different way of providing a type annotation.  The most common situation that is going to come up while you're learning is the use of the `.collect()` method on iterators. When you process data using an iterator chain, and eventually you want to make a `Vec` of the results, you'll need `.collect()`. The thing is, `collect` wants you to tell it what kind of container you want. It doesn't just assume you want a `Vec`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// Imagine \"data\" is a Vec of String\n",
    "let results = data.iter()\n",
    "                .map(|s| s.to_uppercase())\n",
    "                .collect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will fail because the compiler wants to you to tell it what kind of container you wish `collect()` to produce.  Easy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let results: Vec<String> = data.iter()\n",
    "                               .map(|s| s.to_uppercase())\n",
    "                               .collect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, the compiler will be able to figure out the item of the `Vec` so you don't need to provide that; it only really needed the container type, so this will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let results: Vec<_> = data.iter()\n",
    "                          .map(|s| s.to_uppercase())\n",
    "                          .collect()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whither the turbofish? Well, the following is *completely equivalent*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "let results = data.iter()\n",
    "                  .map(|s| s.to_uppercase())\n",
    "                  .collect::<Vec<_>>()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see I snuck that `::<Vec<_>>` in there? It's the same type signature as what we had before, it just moved inside the fish. It's like the fish swallowed it!\n",
    "\n",
    "After you convince yourself that the turbofish is just doing the same thing as the original type signature, you're going to wonder, \"What is the point of two ways to give a type?\"  Well, it turns out that because Rust is an *expression-based* language, you will frequently find yourself in situations where it is convenient to provide parameters \"inline\". It's hard to explain, but maybe an example might work.  Here, presented without context, is a real example from some hobby code I worked on:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "  // `templates` is a HashMap<String, String>\n",
    "  let template_fields = templates\n",
    "      .get(&cf.template)\n",
    "      .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!(\n",

    "          &t, templates.keys().collect::<Vec<_>>()\n",
    "      ))?;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not going to explain everything, but I just want to point out the call to `.collect()` in the code above. Because of the turbofish, I am able to provide a type to the `.collect()` call. If I could not use the turbofish, I'd have to have done this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "  // `templates` is a HashMap<String, String>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very similar, but less fluid because I needed to generate the keys away from where they're provided to the `anyhow!` macro call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, maybe my example isn't great. It's just what I happened to have had lying around while I wrote this. The point is: don't be scared of the turbofish, it's harmless."

    "\n",
    "While you're learning Rust, most of your programs are probably going to be command-line programs, i.e., applications. I strongly suggest you use a crate called `anyhow` to help you deal with error handling. Rust is quite pedantic about types and it can be a frustrating experience trying to figure out exactly how to deal with error types.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never want to deal with error types, you could just call `.unwrap()` on every `Result` type; however, this is a bad habit to get into, even when you're just learning. For one thing, it means that later you will have to go back and fix up all the `.unwrap()` calls if you get to the point where you want to clean up your program. But the more unfortunate thing is that you never get to learn how to deal with errors correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the dilemma:\n",
    "- You want to avoid calling `.unwrap()`\n",
    "- You also want to avoid writing `match` statements every single time some function returns a `Result` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do? This scenario is described in The Book, where the `?` operator is introduced. Within a function that returns `Result`, if you call another function that returns `Result` you can use `?` to automatically either get the `Ok()` value, or propagate the `Err` up to the caller. That's wordy, but this is all I mean:\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "This `?` is great, but there's a big problem: the ellipses I used for the error type returned by `my_func` above is quite complicated to deal with if it doesn't match the `Err` type that `some_other_func()` can return. If the two error types are incompatible, the Rust compiler will complain. \n",

    "If you use `anyhow`, you won't have to worry about error types. The code will look like this:\n",

    "There is a library called [paw]() that makes it very, very easy to add robust support to your CLI applications for command-line parameters. It also integrates with another library `structopt` which allows command-line parameters to be defined declaratively.  Also, in the example below I show also how to set up the `stderrlog` crate from options provided on the command line.\n",
