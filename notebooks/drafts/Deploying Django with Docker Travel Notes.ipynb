    "I decided to build my own docker image for a Django deploy. My ultimate goal was to deploy on AWS. My plan is to start on a single EC2 instance, and then once I know how that works, move to a Beanstalk configuration that will allow auto-scaling. If I could avoid beanstalk and just use the load balancer to bring scale as needed, that would be great as I really don't understand how beanstalk does anything and the docs are entirely opaque to me."
